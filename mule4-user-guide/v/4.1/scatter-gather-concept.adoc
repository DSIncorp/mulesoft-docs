= About Scatter-Gather
:imagesdir: ./_images

The Scatter-Gather component is a routing event processor. It concurrently sends a request event to multiple targets, then collects the responses from all routes, and aggregates them into a single message.

Scatter-Gather directs messages through two or more processing routes. Using Scatter-Gather to direct messages through only one processing route throws an exception. +
Applications do not start if Scatter-Gather has been configured with less than two routes.

Scatter-Gather executes routes concurrently instead of sequentially. Parallel execution of routes greatly increases the efficiency of your application and provides more information than sequential processing.

In Anypoint Studio, you can download and open the example project _Scatter-Gather Flow Control_ from Anypoint Exchange to learn more about how to use the Scatter-Gather component. This example shows the usage of the scatter-gather control flow to aggregate data in parallel and return the result in JSON.

The example uses prepared data as input for two resources that should be aggregated. The data represents information about two contacts and has the following structure:

|===
Resource|`firstname`|`surname`|`phone`|`email`
|contacts-1.csv
|John
|Doe
|096548763
|john.doe@texasComp.com

|contacts-2.csv
|Jane
|Doe
|091558780
|jane.doe@texasComp.com
|===

[DataWeave](https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-user-guide/v/current/dataweave) is used to aggregate the data.

The information about the contacts is aggregated to a JSON structure that represents data from both resources (`contacts-1.csv` and `contacts-2.csv`).
