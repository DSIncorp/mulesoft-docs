= Preparing for a Migration to Mule 4
*Manual Migration*

Mule 4 introduces many changes, so plan accordingly before attempting to migrate
from Mule 3.

MuleSoft recommends that you develop all _new_ projects on Mule 4 if these
conditions are met:

* You and your team have updated your skills for Mule 4 through the
documentation or formal training.
* You have the proper deployment environment (see <<prepare_to_deploy>>).
* You do not require all Mule apps to be on a single version of Mule (see below).

*Important!* For projects that are already in development or deployed on Mule 3
(whether a prospect or customer), MuleSoft recommends that you use the
link:migration-tool[Mule Migration tool].

Migrate your Mule apps if any _one_ of the following conditions is met:

* The 3.x version you are using reaches end of life.
* You want to make significant updates to the existing apps.
* You want to take advantage of key Mule 4 capabilities.
* You decide to upgrade all your apps to Mule 4 because you require all apps
to be on the same version (applies to some on-premises customers).

== Set Up Your Local Development Environment

First, you will need to download Studio 7 and install it. If you're deploying
locally, you also need to download the Mule 4 standalone runtime.
