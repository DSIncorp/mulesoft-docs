= Migrating Connectors and Modules to Mule 4

IMPORTANT: MuleSoft recommends using the link:migration-tool[Mule Migration Tool].
The tool's Migration report will indicate whether any manual migration procedures described here are necessary.

This section covers the manual migration of connector-specific features and lists connectors that are deprecated or removed from Mule 4.

*Important!* If you have not yet used the Mule Migration tool to start migrating
your Mule 3 app to Mule 4, see recommendations link:migration-tool[Migrating to Mule 4] before attempting a manual migration.
