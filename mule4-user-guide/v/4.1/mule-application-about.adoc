You typically create Mule apps to perform system integrations. Mule apps are configured to run in Mule Runtime. A request to a Mule app triggers Mule to encode the request and data in a Mule Event, and to pass it along a single or multiple threads.

The main building blocks of Mule apps are components. Components execute business logic on the messages that flow through your apps. There are three categories of component: core components, components that are grouped into collections named _connectors_, and components that are grouped into collections named _modules_.

Core components::
Here is a sampling of the features that core components let you add to your apps:
+
* Asynchronous processing of parts of a flow or subflow
* Batch processing of messages
* Initiating subflows
* Logging
* Setting payloads
* Transforming messages with the DataWeave language
* Creating Try scopes in your flows, so that you can catch and respond to errors
+
For example, the Choice router is a component that dynamically routes messages through a flow according to a set of DataWeave expressions that evaluate message content. Each expression is associated with a different routing option. The effect is to add conditional processing to a flow, similar to an `if`/`then`/`else` code block in most programming languages.

Connectors::
Connectors group together components that facilitate integration of MuleSoft applications with any external resource, such as third-party APIs or standard integration protocols. They enable connectivity to SaaS and on-premises applications, systems, and services.

For example, the HTTP connector

Another example is the Salesforce Connector lets you connect to the Salesforce platform APIs.

Modules::
Modules process messages, but they do not execute any business logic as they do so. Instead, they add flexibility to your apps by allowing you to aggregate values, compress data, use Java features, use extra features for processing JSON, and more. Modules are similar to components, but the features they offer are more at the level of traditional application coding.
+
For example, the XML module provides components that can process and extract data from an XML document.

Mule apps are defined in an XML document that specifies dependencies needed to run the app. Though it is possible to write the XML by hand, you can use the graphical user interfaces in Design Center or Anypoint Studio. As you use these GUIs to structure and define the behavior of your Mule app, the underlying XML is provided for you. In Studio, the XML is also available for viewing and editing.
