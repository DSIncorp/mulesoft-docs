= Performing a Migration to Mule 4

//TODO: FOR GA, REMOVE *Beta* FROM GA VERSION
*Beta Release: Mule Migration Tool and Compatibility Module*

MuleSoft recommends that you follow this migration path from Mule 3 to Mule 4.

[[min_reqs]]
== Requirements

Minimum requirements for a migrated app:

* Studio 7.2.x (with support for Mule Runtime 4.1.3 or above).
+
You can check your Studio version by navigating to
*Anypoint Studio -> About Anypoint Studio*.

The tool migrates Mule apps that use these versions of the Mule runtime:

* 3.9.x
* 3.8.x

See also, <<unsupported_projects>>.

[[premigration_tasks]]

== Pre-Migration Tasks

If your app is using DataMapper, MuleSoft recommends that you migrate to DataWeave
before running the Mule Migration tool. See <<datamapper>>.

[[run_tool]]
== Running the Mule Migration Tool

//TODO: FOR GA, REMOVE NOTE AND REVISE CONTENT TO DESCRIBE STUDIO WORKFLOW
*Note on the Beta release*: For the Beta release, the migrator is a command-line
utility (packaged as an executable JAR file). After the Beta program, the
Mule Migration tool will be released as part of Studio. You will then be able
to perform migrations through Studio, rather than from the command line.

//TODO: GET A JAR NAME THAT IS MORE LIKE WHAT CUSTOMERS WILL SEE
//TODO: LINK OUT TO STUDIO IMPORT STEPS.
To run the Mule Migration tool:

. Make sure that the required software is installed
(see <<min_reqs, Requirements>>).
. In your console, provide a command that specifies all the required <<options>>,
for example:
+
.Command-line Invocation
[source,console,linenums]
----
$ java -jar mule-migration-tool-runner-0.1.0.jar \
 -projectBasePath /Users/me/AnypointStudio/workspace-studio/my-v6-project \
 -muleVersion 4.1.3 \
 -destinationProjectBasePath /Users/me/my-dir/my-migrated-project
----
+
Note that for `-destinationProjectBasePath` option, the folder (for example,
`my-migrated-project`) in which to place the migrated must _not_ exist. The tool
will create it. If you point to a folder that exists already, the migration will
fail an error like this: `Exception: Destination folder already exists.`
+
When the migrator runs successfully, you will see a message something like this:
+
.Successful Migration
[source,console,linenums]
----
Executing migration...
...
========================================================
MIGRATION SUCCESS
========================================================
Total time: 11.335 s
Migration report:
/Users/me/my-dir/my-migrated-project/report/summary.html
----
+
. Import the project to a supported version of Studio
(see <<min_reqs, Requirements>>).
+
In Studio, you can import the project by going to *File -> Import*, then from the
dialog that opens, *Anypoint Studio -> Anypoint Studio Project from File System*.
+
. Open and check the Migration report (`summary.html`) at the path provided in
the console output  (under your
  `_destinationProjectBasePath_/report/summary.html`).
+
To understand errors and warnings in the Migration report, see
link:migration-report[Migration Report].
+
Also note that the same information is provided as comments in the
Mule Configuration XML files for your project that the Mule Migration tool
outputs.
+
. Address the errors in the report, and address the warnings before deploying
the migrated app to a production environment.
+
The migrated app will not run in Studio if there are any unresolved
errors in it.
+
The link:migration-tool#compatibility_module[Compatibilty module] can work
around warnings until you or your team can address them with permanent fixes.
However, addressing the warnings is important for improving the performance of
the flows, so you should treat warnings the same way you treat errors before you
deploy your app to a production environment.
+
. Identify and consider additional migration steps where the automated migration
by the tool can be improved. See
link:migration-tool-post-mig[Migration to Mule 4: Recommended Migration Tasks] and
<<devkit>>.
+
This step includes removing Compatibility module components from the project XML.
+
. Run any migrated MUnit tests.
+
See <<munit, Testing the Migrated App>>.

[[options]]
== Command-line Options

The migrator is a command-line tool. You simply input a Mule 3 project and
target version and then output the results.

.Command-line Options
|===
| `-destinationProjectBasePath <arg>` | Required. Directory for the migrated
project that includes a destination folder for the migrated project, for
example, `/path/to/my/destination-folder`. The tool will create the
`destination-folder`. It will produce an error if `destination-folder` already
exists.
| `-help` | For displaying the help.
| `-muleVersion <arg>` | Required. The Mule version to which you are migrating: `4.1.3`.
| `-projectBasePath <arg>` a| Required. Directory of the project to migrate.

To discover the path to your Mule 3 project from Studio, you can go to
*File -> Switch Workspace -> Other...*, copy the path that appears in
the *Workspace* field. You need to append the name of your project
to that path when you use it as the `<arg>`
to `-projectBasePath`, for example:

`-projectBasePath /Users/me/AnypointStudio/workspace-studio/my-v6-project`
|===

Whenever the tool adds an entry to the report (either error or warning), the
same information is also added as a comment in the Configuration XML file for the
project.

[[munit]]
=== Testing the Migrated App

Automatic migration of MUnit tests is supported by this tool, so the first step
should be to run those migrated tests. Once those tests are all passing, you
can perform any additional testing that you were already performing on the
original version of the app.

In either case, do expect some of these tests to fail. Manual intervention might
be required to deal with additional details that are not automatically handled
by the tool.

[[datamapper]]
== Migrating DataMapper

DataMapper is not supported by the Mule Migration tool. However, you can
use the DataWeave Migrator tool.

. Before migrating to Mule 4, migrate your DataMapper transformations to
DataWeave using the
link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/dataweave-migrator[DataWeave Migrator Tool]
(available for Mule 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9).
. Run the Mule Migration tool.

[[devkit]]
== Migrating Custom DevKit Connectors

Mule apps might contain custom-made DevKit connectors. Though the
tool cannot migrate them, the link:/mule-sdk/v/1.1/dmt[DevKit Migration tool]
is available to convert these DevKit projects to Mule 4 SDK ones. After
migrating them, you then need to:

* Manually add the migrated modules to the app's `pom.xml`.
* Manually adapt all the uses of such connectors.

[[unsupported_projects]]
==== Migrating from Unsupported Runtime Versions

If you want to migrate apps that are currently running on unsupported
runtime versions such as 3.7.x, 3.6.x or before, you can still use the migrator. However, a greater ratio of migration errors, unsupported patterns, or
incorrect code generation is to be expected.

Although MuleSoft will not officially support these cases, it is probably a
good idea to try the tool on them anyway. Dealing with limitations is likely
to be much easier than dealing with a completely unaided migration.
