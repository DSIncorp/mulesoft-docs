= Migrating Message Properties
// Contacts/SMEs: Ana Felissati, Pablo La Greca

IMPORTANT: MuleSoft recommends using the link:migration-tool[Mule Migration Tool].
The tool's Migration report will indicate whether any manual migration procedures identified here are necessary.

In Mule 3, there are several property scopes that you can use for different purposes. In Mule 4, most of these scopes have been removed.

== Invocation Properties

Invocation properties are now called `variables` in Mule 4. Their behavior is exactly the same as in Mule 3.

== Inbound Properties, Outbound Properties, Inbound and Outbound Attachments

These scopes do not exist in Mule 4. For information about migrating them, see:

* link:migration-tool-post-mig[Migration to Mule 4: Recommended Post-Migration Tasks]

* link:intro-mule-message[Intro Mule Message]
