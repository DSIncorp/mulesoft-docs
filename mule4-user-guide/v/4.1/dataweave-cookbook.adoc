|Example |Description |DataWeave Function

|link:dataweave-cookbook-extract-data[Extract Data]
| Shows common selector expressions for extracting values from a data source, such as a Mule message. | 

| link:dataweave-cookbook-perform-basic-transformation[Transform a Format] | Transforms a format using selectors instead of functions. | 

| link:dataweave-cookbook-map[Map Data]
| Reorganizes fields in a JSON array, and coerce a String into a Number. | `map`, `as`

| link:dataweave-cookbook-map-an-object[Map an Object]
| Sets all the keys in an object to upper case. | `mapObject`

| link:dataweave-cookbook-map-object-elements-as-an-array[Map Object Elements as an Array]
| Picks out the keys in an object that are named "book" and return the keys as an array, then, iterate through the array. | Multi-value selector, `map`

| link:dataweave-cookbook-rename-keys[Rename Keys]
| Renames some keys in a JSON object while retaining the names of all other keys in the output. |  `mapObject`, `if`, `as`, and `and`.

| link:dataweave-cookbook-output-a-field-when-present[Conditionally Output a Field]
| Determines whether to include a field in the output, for example, excluding fields that contain sensitive data. | `map`, `if`

| link:dataweave-cookbook-format-according-to-type[Format According to Type]
| Applies changes to the keys in an object, depending on the type of their corresponding values. | `mapObject`, `camelize`, `capitalize`, and `pluralize`, with `if` and `else if`

| link:dataweave-cookbook-regroup-fields[Regroup Fields]
| Reorganizes JSON and XML fields. | `groupBy`, `mapObject`, and `map`

| link:dataweave-cookbook-zip-arrays-together[Zip Arrays Together]
| Rearranges pairs of similar arrays so that they form a series of touples with the matching values from each. | `zip`

| link:dataweave-cookbook-pick-top-elements[Pick Top Elements]
| Sorts a list of candidates according to their score at a test, then it splits the array to select only the top candidates. | `groupBy` and `map`


| link:dataweave-cookbook-change-value-of-a-field[Change the Value of a Field]
| Masks sensitive data by changing values of some keys to asterisks (`\****``). |  `mapObject`, `if`, and `else`


| link:dataweave-cookbook-exclude-field[Exclude Fields from the Output]
| Shows how to exclude unwanted elements from the output.|  `-` (remove) and `mapObject`

| link:dataweave-cookbook-use-constant-directives[Use Constant Directives]
| Defines a series of constant strings and numbers in the header, in order to filter input and to concatenate into URLs. | `map`, `if` and `++` 

| link:dataweave-cookbook-define-a-custom-addition-function[Define a Custom Addition Function]
| Defines a function that obtains totals and subtotals. Also performs additions, subtractions and multiplications of numeric values. |  `accumulator`

| link:dataweave-cookbook-define-function-to-flatten-list[Define a Function that Flattens Data in a List]
| Modifies and conditionally output fields from a list. | `reduce`, `map`, `if`, and `splitBy`


| link:dataweave-cookbook-output-self-closing-xml-tags[Output Self-Closing XML Tags]
| Closes empty tags such as `<element2/>`. | `inlineCloseOn="empty"`

| link:dataweave-cookbook-insert-attribute[Insert an Attribute into an XML Tag]
| Creates an XML attribute. | `@(key:value)`


| link:dataweave-cookbook-remove-certain-xml-attributes[Remove Certain XML Attributes]
| Defines a function that recursively checks an element and all of its children for a specific XML attribute and removes it |  `-`, `mapObject`, `if`, and `is` to match types.


| link:dataweave-cookbook-include-xml-namespaces[Include XML Namespaces]
| Defines multiple XML namespaces and references these in each tag. | 


| link:dataweave-cookbook-reference-multiple-inputs[Reference Multiple Inputs]
| References data in the payload, a message attribute and a variable, and processes them. | `map`, `filter` and multiplications. 

| link:dataweave-cookbook-merge-multiple-payloads[Merge Multiple Payloads]
| References data that arrives in multiple separate payloads from one single Mule event. Filters the output based on a unique identifier. | `map`, `using`, `as`, and `filter`


| link:dataweave-cookbook-use-constant-directives[Use Constant Directives]
| Defines a `var` in the DataWeave header that builds URLs from constant directives to concatenate strings. | `++`

| link:dataweave-cookbook-parse-dates[Parse Dates]
| Defines a function that normalizes conflicting date formats into a single, common format. |  `mapObject`, `replace`, and `as` to coerce a data type.

| link:dataweave-cookbook-add-and-subtract-time[Add and Subtract Dates]
| Performs multiple math operations combining different types related to date and time. | 

| link:dataweave-cookbook-conditional-list-reduction-via-function[Conditionally Reduce a List Via a Function]
| Defines a function that reduces a list of elements into one field, then calls the function only when a certain field has values. | `map`, `reduce`, `splitBy`, `if`, and `++` to append to an array.

| link:dataweave-cookbook-map-based-on-an-external-definition[Dynamic Mapping Based On a Definition]
| Transforms the payload according to definitions sent in a variable, then defines a function that applies the logic defined in the variable | `map` and `default`

|  link:dataweave-cookbook-pass-functions-as-arguments[Passing Functions as Arguments]
| Defines a function that expects to receive two inputs: a function to apply and an element to apply it on. The function is also recursively applied to the element's children. | `mapObject` `lower` `is` `if/else`
