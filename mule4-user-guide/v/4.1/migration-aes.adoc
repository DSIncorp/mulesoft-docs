= Migrating the Anypoint Enterprise Security (AES) features

IMPORTANT: MuleSoft recommends using the link:migration-tool[Mule Migration Tool].
The tool's Migration report will indicate whether any manual migration procedures described here are necessary.

In Mule 4, the Anypoint Enterprise Security module was split into different modules:

* link:cryptography[Cryptography Module] replaces the Mule 3 Encryption and Signature modules
* link:secure-configuration-properties[Secure Configuration Properties Module] replaces the Mule 3 Secure Property Placeholder
* link:/connectors/validation-connector[Validation Module] incorporated functionality from the Mule 3 Filters Module
* link:/connectors/oauth2-provider-documentation-reference[OAauth2 Provider] replaces the Mule 3 OAuth2 Provider

Please refer to the above module documentation for information on how to migrate to Mule 4.
