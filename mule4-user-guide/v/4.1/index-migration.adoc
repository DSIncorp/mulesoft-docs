Mule 4 improvements make it easier to learn, develop, and manage than Mule 3. For an overview of these capabilities, you should read link:mule-runtime-updates[What's New in Mule 4].

This documentation describes the differences between Mule 3 and Mule 4, indicates when you should migrate to Mule 4, and shows what it takes to migrate Mule apps with the Migration tool. It includes information on these topics:

* link:intro-overview[Introduction to Mule 4]: An overview of Mule 4 for those who already know Mule 3.
* link:migration-prep[Preparing for a Migration]: Steps to think about before migrating a Mule app.
* link:migration-tool[Migration to Mule 4]: An overview of migration using the
Mule Migration tool and recommended migration tasks.
* link:migration-example-complex[Migration Example]: End-to-end example that shows the before (Mule 3) and after (Mule 4) syntax used for Mule apps.
