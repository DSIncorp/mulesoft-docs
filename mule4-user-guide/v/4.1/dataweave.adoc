DataWeave 2.0 is the MuleSoft expression language for accessing and transforming data received through a Mule app. DataWeave is integrated with Mule Runtime (Mule), which runs the scripts and expressions in your Mule app.

To get started with DataWeave 2.0:

* New to Mulesoft? Use the link:dataweave-quickstart[DataWeave Tutorial] to create an app and your first DataWeave transformation.
* If you've used DataWeave 1.0 and have code you need to migrate, visit link:migration-dataweave[Migrating from DataWeave 1.0 to 2.0].
* If don't have any DataWeave 1.0 scripts, and you are comfortable creating a simple Mule app, review link:dw-language-guide[DataWeave Language Guide] to learn how 2.0 differs from 1.0. 
* If you just need to look something up, use the link:dw-functions[DataWeave 2.0 Reference Guide].
