DataWeave 2.0 is the MuleSoft expression language for accessing and transforming data received through a Mule app. DataWeave acts on data in the Mule event. Most often, you use it to access and transform data in the message payload. For example, after a component in your app retrieves data from one system, you can use DataWeave to modify and output selected fields in that data to a new data format, then use another component in your app to pass on that data to another system.
