= Fork a Project in the RAML Editor

You can separate new iterations of a project from previous iterations by branching.

== About this task

A new branch is a fork of your project and cannot be merged back into the master branch. Anybody who has access to your project can also create branches.

Even when there are forks of a project, when you open that project the editor opens it to the master branch. If you want to return to a fork that you were working in, you must select that fork.

You can publish any fork of an API specification to Anypoint Exchange.
