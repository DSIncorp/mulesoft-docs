= Export Files from an API Project

You can export your API-specification or API-fragment project as a `.zip` file, if you want to work on it in another tool, such as API Workbench. You can also export an API specification, converting the specification from RAML 1.0 to OAS 2.0.

[NOTE]
====
When you export a API specification to an OAS .json file or .yaml file, the conversion follows the rules that are documented at  https://github.com/mulesoft/oas-raml-converter/blob/master/docs/RAML10-to-OAS20.md[_Export from RAML 1.0 to OAS 2.0_] in the documentation for MuleSoft's oas-raml-converter tool.
