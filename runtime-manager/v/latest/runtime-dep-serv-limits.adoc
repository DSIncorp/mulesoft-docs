= About Hard Limits on Scaling Deployments and Servers

To ensure platform stability and performance, Anypoint Platform has set the following hard limits on the number of deployments and servers that you can have in a hybrid deployment scenario. These hard limits apply to individual environments in a business group.

If you need to create additional deployments or servers beyond these hard limits, you can use different accounts, environments, or business groups. If you need to exceed the hard limits within the same environment, contact your customer success representative.
