= Custom Message Persistence and Retrieval

NOTE: Current Anypoint Partner Manager solutions will continue to be supported in accordance with the Product Support and Maintenance Terms  but will not be available for new customers or upgrades. Contact your MuleSoft representative for more information on MuleSoft's B2B solutions.

The PMC configuration should be the partner-manager:config-file-storage-custom version, then set the flow that will do the persisting and the place where the url will be pulled from.  The PMC will use this config to invoke the flow at the correct time and then store the ulr for that message with the tracking data in Partner Manager.

The simplest pattern is to generate a new UUID and associate it somehow with the persisted message (in this example I put that in the file name, usually you would use a db and put the id there.)

This url is used in the Tracking UI to view a persisted payload.

Then in the retrieval api flow, you just pull the id out of the url and use it to locate the persisted payload and return it.

Of course you would likely secure that api, so we provide a way to configure the security settings for several common security schemes:
