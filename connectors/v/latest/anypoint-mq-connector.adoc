:keywords: mq, connector

_Select_

The Anypoint MQ connector provides publish-subscribe messaging to Mule applications in the cloud or on-premise using the Anypoint MQ cloud service.

Anypoint MQ supports a wide range of messaging use cases: enterprise messaging patterns, asynchronous communications between microservices, IoT, and more.  Anypoint MQ also has a REST api for publishing or consuming messages using any framework such as node.js, Java, Go, and devops bash scripts.

== Prerequisites

To use this connector, you should be familiar with Anypoint Studio, Anypoint connectors, and Mule flows. The Anypoint MQ connector is free, but connecting to the service in Anypoint Platform requires a license.

*Note:* You cannot complete the configuration information in this document without an Anypoint MQ license. Contact MuleSoft Sales for a trial license.

=== Compatibility

== Using MQ as a Trigger in Design Center

Using MQ as a trigger means that the MQ subscriber in Design Center waits for a message to consume. 
The message the trigger consumes is sent by an MQ connector instance running either in Anypoint Studio or 
Runtime Manager that publishes messages. The messages that MQ connector publishes come from either the 
MQ UI in Anypoint Platform or from calls to the REST API.

. In Anypoint Platform > Design Center, create a Mule Application.
. For the trigger, select *Anypoint MQ*.
. For the Destination, type the MQ queue name or message exchange you want to subscribe to.
. If needed, click Advanced to specify an output MIME type and output encoding for the messages you receive.
. Click Set Up to specify the client ID, client secret, and region. 
. Open a second window to Anypoint Platform > MQ > Client Apps to get the client ID and secret for an application.
. Copy and paste the client ID and secret into the Design Center user interface. 
. In MQ, copy the region from the main screen, for example, `+https://mq-us-east-1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v1+` for US East Virginia and paste that in the Design Center URL field.

== Installing the MQ Connector in Studio

From Anypoint Exchange:

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio task bar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. Search for the connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

Manually:

. Open your Mule project in Anypoint Studio.
. Add the connector as a dependency in the pom.xml file:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.mulesoft.connectors</groupId>
  <artifactId>anypoint-mq-connector</artifactId>
  <version>3.0.0</version>
  <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
----

== To Configure with the Studio Visual Editor

. In Studio, click File > New > Mule Project.
. Search for "http" and drag the HTTP connector to the Studio Canvas. Click the HTTP connector, and click the green plus sign to the right of Connector Configuration. Click OK to accept the defaults. In the HTTP properties window, set the Path to `/mq/{messageId}`.
. Search for "mq" and drag the *Anypoint MQ* connector to the canvas. If you cannot find this connector, return to
<<To Install This Connector>> and ensure you installed the connector.
. Click the green plus sign to the right of Connector Configuration.

=== Specify Global Element Properties

. Specify the URL for the region you want your MQ queues and exchanges to reside.
+
Possible values are:
+
** North America:
*** US East (N. Virginia): `+https://mq-us-east-1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v1+`
*** US West (Oregon): `+https://mq-us-west-2.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v1+`
*** Central Canada: `+https://mq-ca-central-1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v1+`
** Europe:
*** EU (Ireland): `+https://mq-eu-west-1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v1+`
*** EU (London): `+https://mq-eu-west-2.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v1+`
** APAC:
*** Asia Pacific (Singapore): `+https://mq-ap-southeast-1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v1+`
*** Asia Pacific (Sydney): `+https://mq-ap-southeast-2.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v1+`
+
FIFO queues can reside in US East, US West, and EU Ireland.
+
. In Anypoint Platform, click MQ > Client Apps. If needed, create a client app.
. Copy the Anypoint Platform > MQ > Client App > Client App ID value to Studio's Client ID field.
. Copy the Client App > Client Secret value to Studio's Client Secret field. You can ignore the other settings to test your connector.
. Click OK.

=== Set the Operation

. Click the *Operation* field and specify an operation such as Publish or Consume. 
. If using the Publish or Consume operations, specify the *Destination* as the name of the queue or message exchange that you set in Anypoint Platform.
. For the Publish operation, you can leave the Message ID field empty, or specify a message ID if you want to publish a specific message ID. If a message ID is not set, MQ auto generates a unique message ID for each message thatâ€™s sent to a queue. When publishing to FIFO queues, if you specify a Message ID and the Message ID is the same on multiple messages, the messages with the same Message ID are not redelivered.

Possible operations are:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Operation |Description
|link:/connectors/anypoint-mq-connector-reference#ack[Ack] |Indicates that the message has been consumed correctly and deletes the message from in-flight status.
|link:/connectors/anypoint-mq-connector-reference#consume[Consume] |Consumes messages from a queue.
|link:/connectors/anypoint-mq-connector-reference#nack[Nack] |Changes the status of the message from in-flight to in-queue to be consumed again by a subscriber.
|link:/connectors/anypoint-mq-connector-reference#publish[Publish] |Publishes messages
to a queue or message exchange.
|===

For a list of configuration fields for each operation, see the link:/connectors/anypoint-mq-connector-reference[Anypoint MQ Connector Reference].

== XML and Standalone Configuration

For a list of XML fields, see link:/connectors/anypoint-mq-connector-reference[Anypoint MQ Connector Reference].

=== MQ Schema and Endpoint

If you are creating an XML or standalone application, add this dependency to your pom.xml file:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.mulesoft.connectors</groupId>
  <artifactId>anypoint-mq-connector</artifactId>
  <version>4.0.0</version>
  <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
----

*Note:* If you are creating an application using Anypoint Studio, when you install the MQ connector, the MQ dependency
in the pom.xml file is updated for you.

Additional dependencies for Gradle, EBT, and Ivy are listed in Anypoint Exchange in the https://www.anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/org.mule.tooling.messaging/mule-module-anypoint-mq-ee-studio/[Anypoint MQ Connector] asset. Click Dependency Snippets for a complete list.
