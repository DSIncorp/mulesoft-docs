= IBM MQ Connector
:keywords: jms, ibm, ibm mq, mq, connector, jms_1.1, jms_2.0

The IBM MQ Connector enables your application to do messaging to a IBM MQ Broker
using the IBM MQ JMS Implementation.  Its main features include:

* Pub/Sub pattern support on any given destination.
* Listen/Reply pattern support on any given destination.
* Publish-Consume pattern support on any given destination, with fixed or temporary reply Queue.
* Non-blocking publishing and consumption of messages.

=== Connection Mode

When creating the IBM Configuration the first thing that is required to choose
is the https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_9.0.0/com.ibm.mq.dev.doc/q031720_.htm[connection mode] to use.

Since IBM MQ 8, there are only two available connection modes, *Client* and *Binding*.

==== Client Connection Mode

The client connection mode lets you connect to the IBM MQ Queue Manager running
in the same system that is being run the Mule Application or in other system.
In both cases the IBM MQ Connector will connect to the IBM MQ Queue Manager
over TCP/IP.

For this connection mode are available the following configurations:

[width="100%",cols="^2s,^1m,^1m,15m",options="header,footer"]
|=======
|Parameter |Required |Default Value |Description
|Host |TRUE | | Host where the IBM MQ Broker is.
|Port |FALSE |1414 |Queue Manager listener port
|Queue Manager |FALSE | |The queue manager which is used when selecting a channel definition
|Channel |FALSE | |Name of the channel to connect to
|Connection Name List |FALSE | |Hosts to which the client will attempt to reconnect to after its connection is broken. +
      The connection name list is a comma separated list of host/ip port pairs. *Example:* _0.0.0.0(1414),somehost.domain.com(1415)_

		</ibm-mq:connection-mode>
	</ibm-mq:connection>
</ibm-mq:config>

==== Binding Connection Mode

The binding connection mode connects to automatically with the IBM MQ broker
running in the same system.

The unique parameter that is optionally configurable is the Queue Manager to
connect to. If the IBM MQ broker has a default Queue Manager, this configuration
is not required.

  <ibm-mq:connection >
    <ibm-mq:connection-mode >
      <ibm-mq:binding queueManager="QM1" />
    </ibm-mq:connection-mode>
  </ibm-mq:connection>
</ibm-mq:config>

=== Defining Global Defaults

The IBM MQ `config` allows you to define multiple parameters that will be used as
a default while consuming or publishing messages. This way, you can define a
global default behavior for all the operations associated the config and then
override each parameter only in the operations that require a custom behavior.

For example, we can define a default `selector` behavior when consuming a Message
 in any of the operations that are associated to this config, and also a default

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<ibm-mq:config name="IBM_MQ_Config">
  <ibm-mq:connection/>
  <ibm-mq:consumer-config selector="JMSType = `INVOICE`"/>
  <ibm-mq:producer-config timeToLive="60000"/>
</ibm-mq:config>
----

In this case, every operation `consume` or `listener` associated to this config
will use this `selector` by default, while every time we do a `publish` or `publish-consume`,
the outgoing Message will have a TTL of 60 seconds.

All of this properties can be overridden at operation level when required. Let's
 say we need to `publish` a Message with a shorter TTL, we can do so using this
 config and overriding the parameter:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<ibm-mq:publish config-ref="IBM_MQ_Config" timeToLive="10000"/>
----

=== Selecting the JMS Spec

TIP: The main common parameter is the JMS `specification`, used to select between
 all the supported specs, which are `2.0` and `1.1` This `specification` must be
  supported by the broker implementation associated to this connection, otherwise
   the connection will fail.

WARNING: Features available only in JMS `2.0` won't work with any other `specification`.


=== Providing Credentials For Authentication

In order to do establish an authenticated connection, you need to configure the `username` and `password` in the `connection` element:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<ibm-mq:config name="IBM_MQ_Config">
	<ibm-mq:connection username="<username>" password="<password>" >
		<ibm-mq:connection-mode >
			<ibm-mq:client host="0.0.0.0" port="1414" queueManager="QM1" channel="DEV.ADMIN.SVRCONN" />
		</ibm-mq:connection-mode>
	</ibm-mq:connection>
</ibm-mq:config>
----


=== Configuring Connections Caching

In order to connect with a broker and execute the required operations, the JMS
Connector creates multiple Sessions, Consumers and Producers that can be cached
and reused in order to increase the performance of the application. Because of
this capability, the IBM MQ Connector allows you to configure which `caching-strategy`
to use when creating new Connections, caching by default both Consumers and
Producers and preserving as many instances as possible in memory at the same time.

Customizing the cache configuration can be done directly in the connection declaration:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<ibm-mq:config name="IBM_MQ_Config">
  <ibm-mq:connection>
    <ibm-mq:caching-strategy>
      <ibm-mq:default-caching sessionCacheSize="100" consumersCache="false" producersCache="true"/>
    </ibm-mq:caching-strategy>
  </ibm-mq:connection>
</ibm-mq:config>
----

=== Identifying The Connection Client

The purpose of client identifier is to associate a connection and its objects
with a state maintained on behalf of the client by a provider, and it is *mandatory*
for identifying an unshared durable subscription.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<ibm-mq:config name="IBM_MQ_Config">
  <ibm-mq:connection clientId="${env.clientId}"/>
</ibm-mq:config>
----

WARNING: By definition, the client state identified by a `clientId` can be "in use" by only one Connection at a time.

== Setting Up The Connection Required Libraries

NOTE: No matter what type of connection you are using, you will always need to configure a library containing the *JMS client implementation*, since the connector is not bound to any particular implementation.

=== IBM MQ External Libraries

To use the IBM MQ Connector is required to configure the external IBM MQ library,
The IBM MQ Client library must provide `com.ibm.mq.jms.MQConnectionFactory` implementation.

TIP: Is recommended to the the IBM MQ Allclient library.

For example, you can use:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.ibm.mq</groupId>
    <artifactId>com.ibm.mq.allclient</artifactId>
    <version>9.0.5.0</version>
</dependency>
