_Premium_

The SAP connector enables the integration of data to and from SAP NetWeaver-based and external systems.

Note: This connector is only available in Studio 7 and not available in the Design Center feature of Anypoint Platform.

This connector requires a separate license. Contact MuleSoft to evaluate or use this connector in production.

Mule runtime supports SAP integration through our Anypoint Connector for SAP, an SAP-certified Java connector that leverages the SAP Java Connector (JCo) libraries, thus allowing Mule applications to:

* Execute BAPI functions over the RFC protocol, supporting the following types:
** Synchronous RFC (sRFC)
** Transactional RFC (tRFC)
** Queued RFC (qRFC)
* Act as a JCo Server to be called as a BAPI over sRFC, tRFC, and qRFC.
* Send IDocs over tRFC and qRFC.
* Receive IDocs over tRFC and qRFC.
* Transform SAP objects (JCo Function/BAPI & IDocs) to and from XML.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, Anypoint Connectors, and
Anypoint Studio.

This document also assumes you have:

* A working knowledge of the SAP business context and in particular, the SAP R/3 and S/4Hana Business Suite.
* Access to the SAP Service Marketplace (SMP) to download the SAP JCo libraries for your instance.
* A basic understanding of the SAP NetWeaver Platform from an administration point of view.
* Some fundamental knowledge of the ABAP language.
* Login credentials to test your connection to your target resource.

For hardware and software requirements and compatibility
information, see the SAP Connector Release Notes.

== What's New in this Connector

This version of the connector drops support for Mule 3.x and adds support for Mule 4.x. Besides this, no functionality was added or removed.

== To Connect in Design Center

This connector version is not supported in Design Center.

== Install the SAP Connector in Studio

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio task bar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. Search for the SAP connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

== Configure in Studio

To use the SAP connector in your Mule application, you can configure a global SAP element if you need more than one SAP connector instance in your Mule project.

The SAP connector object holds the configuration properties that allow you to connect to the SAP server.

To create a configuration for an SAP connector, complete the following steps:

. Go to Global Elements section, and click Create.
. Select either SAP Inbound or SAP Outbound in the Connector Configuration section
. In the General tab pane, enter the required parameters for defining an SAP connection, which your SAP system administrator should supply.

The SAP Global Element Configuration allows you to define connection properties as well as to easily add the required SAP dependencies to your project.

For ease of use, the SAP connector only shows the most common properties as connector parameters. To configure a property that is not listed in the Properties panel, consult the "Extended Properties" section in this guide.

The minimum required attributes to define are:

[[gepparms]]
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|Application Server Host | SAP endpoint
|Username | Username of an authorized SAP user.
|Password | Password credential of an authorized SAP user.
|System Number | System number used to connect to the SAP system.
|Client| The SAP client ID (usually a number) used to connect to the SAP system.
|Login Language | The language to use for the SAP connection. For example, EN for English.
|===

As a best practice, use property placeholder syntax to load the credentials in a more simple and reusable way.

Click the Test button to verify that the connection to the SAP instance succeeded. If the credentials are correct you should receive a Test Connection Successful message.

== Configuring the Connector in Studio 7

. Browse to the SAP web site and download the version 3.0.18 libraries
for IDOC, JCO, and JCO Native. The library formats are usable by
Studio 7 directly without conversion. You can download them to
a folder on your computer. You must have a SAP ID to download the libraries.
+
*Note:* The file types for each library depend on your operating system:
+
** Windows: sapidoc3.jar, sapjco3.jar, sapjco3.dll
** Mac OS:  sapidoc3.jar, sapjco3.jar, libsapjco3.jnilib
** Linux:   sapidoc3.jar, sapjco3.jar, libsapjco3.so
+
. After installing the SAP connector in Studio and adding the connector to your Mule
project, double click the connector in the flow, and click the plus (*+*) sign
to the right of the Connector Configuration field.

----

Inside the `<version>` tags, put the desired version number, the word RELEASE for the latest release, or SNAPSHOT for the latest available version. The available version is: 4.0.0.

== Use Case: Send an IDocument to SAP

The use case describes how to create a Mule application to send an IDocument to SAP.

. Create a new Mule Project in Anypoint Studio.
. Create a new HTTP Listener global element configuration and leave it with the default values.
. Drag a HTTP endpoint onto the canvas and configure the following parameters:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Parameter|Value
|Connector Configuration| HTTP_Listener_Configuration
|Path|/sendIDoc
|===
+
. Create a new SAP Outbound global element configuration and fill with environment values.
. Click Test to confirm that Mule can connect with the SAP instance. If the connection is successful, click OK to save the configuration. Otherwise, review or correct any invalid parameters and test again.
. Select the SAP module and add Send IDoc operation next to the HTTP and in the Extension Configuration field select the configuration created in the previous section.
. Configure the operation with the following values:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Parameter|Value
|Display Name |Send IDoc (or any other name you prefer)
|Connector configuration |SAP_Outbound (name of the global element you have created)
|Key |MATMAS01
|Content |#[payload]
|===
+
. Drag a Transform Message component before the SAP connector, then click the component to open its properties editor. Once metadata has been retrieved, select the respective fields to populate for the Employee. The Transform script should look similar to the following:

=== SAP JCo Architecture

SAP JCo facilitates communication between an SAP backend system and a Java application. It allows Java programs to connect to SAP systems and invoke Remote Function Modules. It also allows parsing of IDocs (SAP Intermediate Documents), among other object types. Both inbound and outbound communications are supported.

* Java API: Handles dynamic metadata lookup and caching. It implements JCO.Function, which is the container for parameters and/or tables for the SAP Function Module (BAPI) in Java. Java applications are built on top of the Java API.

* JNI (Java Native Interface): Originally, SAP created libraries in C language to allow direct RFC calls to SAP, to manipulate with data. JCo wraps C libraries in Java to provide platform-native access into the SAP system. RFC Middleware uses RFC Library through (JNI) Layer.

* RFC (Remote Function Call): Communication with the SAP system is performed over the RFC protocol. RFC means calling BAPI or triggering IDoc processing that runs in another system as calling program. The RFC interface enables function calls between two SAP systems or between the SAP and external system.

* RFC Library: Libraries of C language-based functions to access the SAP system. RFC library is addressed by JNI.

* RFC Layer: SAP component that processes RFC calls.

* SAP Java IDoc Class Library: Provides structured, high-level interpretation and navigation of SAP IDocs in Java. It consists of the following add-on packages:
** SAP Java Base IDoc Class Library: a middleware-independent library that provides a set of general base classes and interfaces for middleware dependent Java IDoc Class Library implementations.
** SAP Java Connector IDoc Class Library: A middleware-independent library for creating, sending, and receiving IDocs.

* FM (Function Module): Function modules are procedures that are defined in the ABAP language of SAP. It allows the encapsulation and reuse of global functions in the SAP System.

* BAPI (Business Application Programming Interface): The Function Module that fulfills certain design criteria, such as:
** Implements a method of a SAP Business Object.
** Maintains a static interface through different versions of the SAP system.
** Is remote-enabled.
** Runs to completion with or without user interaction.
** Handles errors.

* IDoc (Intermediate Document): Standard SAP format for electronic data interchange between SAP systems. Different messages types (such as delivery notes or purchase orders) generally correspond to different special formats, known as IDoc types. Multiple message types with related content can, however, be assigned to a single IDoc type.

* ALE (Application Link Enabling): Technology for setting up and operating distributed applications. ALE facilitates distributed, yet integrated, installation of SAP systems. This involves business-driven message exchange using consistent data across loosely linked SAP applications. Applications are integrated through synchronous and asynchronous communication, rather than by use of a central database.

* SAP NetWeaver: One of the main technologies and application platforms used by SAP solutions. Its main component is the SAP Web Application Server (WebAS), which provides the runtime environment for SAP applications like ERP, CRM, SCM, PLM, SRM, BI. Other components include enterprise portal, exchange infrastructure, master data management and mobile infrastructure. The SAP NetWeaver is an umbrella term for these technical components.

* SAP NetWeaver runs on both Java and ABAP stacks.

* ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming): SAP's proprietary programming language and part of the NetWeaver platform for building business applications.
