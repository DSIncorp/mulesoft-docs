= IBM MQ Tuning For Performance
:keywords: jms, ibm mq, mq, performance, connector, consume, message, source, listener

Performance can be a significant factor when processing many messages, which
means that you probably want to check the following configurations to ensure
you get the most out of the IBM MQ connector.

== Don't Disable Connections Reuse

Connections are expensive to create, so it's important to reuse them as much as possible.

*Notes:*

* By default, the IBM MQ connector uses an aggressive `caching-strategy` that
reuses as many consumers and producers as possible. We recommend that you keep
this configuration untouched since any modification can reduce the performance
of your application.

* Disabling connections caching reduces the performance of your application.

== Increasing Concurrent Messages Processing

A good way to improve the performance of your application is to increase the
number of concurrent consumers that receive messages from the same destination.
This can be done easily in the IBM MQ connector by configuring the `numberOfConsumers`
parameter.

Out of the box, the `listener` uses four consumers concurrently at the same
destination, but you can increase this number to a value that better fits your needs:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<ibm-mq:listener config-ref="config" 
     destination="#[vars.destination]" 
     numberOfConsumers="20"/>
----

TIP: Increasing the `numberOfConsumers` is the easiest way to improve the throughput of your listeners.

== Optimize Your Configuration For Clusters

For applications running in clusters, keep in mind the concept of
*primary node* and how the connector behaves. When running in a cluster,
the IBM MQ `listener` default behavior is to receive messages only at the primary node,
no matter what kind of destination you are consuming from.

In case of consuming messages from a queue, change this configuration to receive messages 
in all the nodes of the cluster,
not just the primary. 

This can be done with the `primaryNodeOnly` parameter:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<ibm-mq:listener config-ref="config" 
     destination="${inputQueue}" 
     primaryNodeOnly="false"/>
----

Consuming messages from a topic is a bit different, since the default behavior
of receiving messages only in the primary node is the most common use case,
given that it avoids processing the same message multiple times across the cluster.

If you are using the JMS 2.0 shared subscriptions mechanism, then you want
to change the cluster configuration to consume from all the nodes, again
setting `primaryNodeOnly` to `false`:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<ibm-mq:listener config-ref="JMS_20_config" 
      destination="${inputTopic}" 
      primaryNodeOnly="false">
     <ibm-mq:consumer-type>
         <ibm-mq:topic-consumer 
         shared="true" 
         subscriptionName="clusteredEventListener"/>
     </ibm-mq:consumer-type>
 </ibm-mq:listener>
----

TIP: When listening from a queue in a cluster, change the `primaryNodeOnly`
configuration to `false`.

WARNING: When listening from a topic in a cluster, not using the `primaryNodeOnly`
configuration causes the cluster to process the same message more than once
unless shared-subscriptions is used.
