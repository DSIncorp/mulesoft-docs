= Compression Module Documentation Reference

+++
A module which provides functionality for compressing and decompressing data.
+++


== Configurations
---
[[config]]
=== Config

+++
Default configuration
+++

==== Parameters
[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|======================
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | *x*{nbsp}
|======================





== Operations

[[archive]]
=== Archive
`<compression:archive>`

+++
Compresses all the given entries into a new file in the configured format. <p> Each entry passed to this operation will be placed inside the compressed archive with the name provided by the user in the DataWeave script. e.g. For this expression: { file: vars.aTxtContent, 'dir/resume.pdf': vars.pdf } The resultant archive will contain 2 entries one named "file" at root level and another one called "resume.pdf" inside a directory called "dir". +- Archive |  \- file1 |  \+ dir1 |  \- file2 As you can see in the example above, the slash "/" in the name of an entry indicates directory separation, so all names will be introspected to create dirs inside the archive.
+++

|======================
| *Type* a| Binary
|======================


==== Throws

[[compress]]
=== Compress
`<compression:compress>`

+++
Compresses a given content using the configured format, ZIP or GZIP. If a problem occur while compressing the content a COULD_NOT_COMPRESS error will be thrown.
+++

==== Parameters
[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|======================
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Content a| Binary |  |  +++#[payload]+++ | {nbsp}

| Target Variable a| String |  +++The name of a variable on which the operation's output will be placed+++ |  | {nbsp}
| Target Value a| String |  +++An expression that will be evaluated against the operation's output and the outcome of that expression will be stored in the target variable+++ |  +++#[payload]+++ | {nbsp}
|======================

==== Output
[cols=".^50%,.^50%"]
|======================
| *Type* a| Binary
|======================


==== Throws
* COMPRESSION:COULD_NOT_COMPRESS {nbsp}


[[decompress]]
=== Decompress
`<compression:decompress>`

+++
Decompresses a given single entry compressed content which is assumed to be in an specific format (ZIP or GZIP). If the given content is not in the configured format an INVALID_ARCHIVE error will be thrown. Compressed archives can have multiple entries, this operation can handle only single entry archives because if the archive would contain more than one the operation wouldn't know which should return, if the content has more than one entry an TOO_MANY_ENTRIES error will be thrown. For multiple entry archives use the `extract` operation of this module, which will let you choose only formats that accept multiple entries.

== Types
[[repeatable-in-memory-stream]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Stream

[cols=".^20%,.^25%,.^30%,.^15%,.^10%", options="header"]
|======================
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | This is the amount of memory that will be allocated in order to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can be fit into this buffer, then it will be expanded by according to the bufferSizeIncrement attribute, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize. |  | 
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much will be buffer size by expanded if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower will mean that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error will be raised when the buffer gets full. |  | 
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | This is the maximum amount of memory that will be used. If more than that is used then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error will be raised. A value lower or equal to zero means no limit. |  | 
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which all these attributes are expressed |  | 
|======================

[[repeatable-file-store-stream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

[cols=".^20%,.^25%,.^30%,.^15%,.^10%", options="header"]
|======================
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max In Memory Size a| Number | Defines the maximum memory that the stream should use to keep data in memory. If more than that is consumed then it will start to buffer the content on disk. |  | 
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which maxInMemorySize is expressed |  |
