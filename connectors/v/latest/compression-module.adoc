A file archiver is a computer program that combines a number of files together into one archive file for easier transportation or storage, and most archivers employ data compression in their archive formats to reduce the size of the final archive. However, not all compression algorithms know how to archive files. Some are limited to single-file data compression.

The Compression module aims to support and provide access to the most-used archiver and compression formats through a Mule app. 

This module aims to compress and decompress files for each of the available formats without losing any of the features that the format associated algorithm provides.

To achieve this, the module provides two pairs of operations, one for compressing and decompressing a single file, another for archiving and extracting a bundle of files. Each of these operations can be configured with the compression or archiving strategies of your choice.


= Compressing and Decompressing a Single File

== Content Compression

Given an input stream, the module compresses the stream and returns a new compressed stream of bits so it can be stored in a file system or transferred to another system.

=== Compressor Strategies

A Compressor strategy can compress a file or a single-entry archive.

==== GZip Compressor Strategy

When used in an operation, this strategy declares that the content should be compressed with the `gzip` format.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<compression:gzip-compressor/>
----

==== Zip Compressor Strategy

When used in an operation, this strategy declares that the content should be compressed with the `zip` format.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<compression:zip-compressor/>
----

=== Compress Operation

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<compression:compress>
   <compression:content>#[payload.data]</compression:content> // <1>
   <compression:compressor>
       <compression:zip-compressor/> // <2>
   </compression:compressor>
</compression:compress>
----


<1> The `InputStream` to be compressed. Defaults to `#[payload]`.

<2> Compressor strategy to be used.

==== Compression Errors

If an error occurs while compressing the content, a `COMPRESSION:COULD_NOT_COMPRESS` error will be thrown.



== Content Decompression

Decompresses single-entry compressed content, which is assumed to be an archive in the specified compression format.

=== Decompressor Strategies

A Decompressor strategy knows how to decompress a file or a single-entry archive.

==== GZip Decompressor Strategy

When used in an operation, this strategy declares that the content should be decompressed with the `gzip` format.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<compression:gzip-decompressor/>
----

==== Zip Decompressor Strategy

When used in an operation, this strategy declares that the content should be decompressed with the `zip` format.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<compression:zip-decompressor/>
----

=== Decompress Operation

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<compression:decompress>
   <compression:content>#[payload]</compression:content> // <1>
   <compression:decompressor>
       <compression:gzip-decompressor/> // <2>
   </compression:decompressor>
</compression:decompress>
----


<1> The `InputStream` to be decompressed. Defaults to `#[payload]`.
<2> Decompressor strategy to be used.

==== Decompression Errors

If the given content does not match the format of the configured strategy, a `COMPRESSION:INVALID_ARCHIVE` error will be thrown.

If the archive to be decompressed has more than one entry, this operation will fail with a `COMPRESSION:TOO_MANY_ENTRIES` error, because it will not be able to choose only one entry to return. For these cases, you should use the Extract operation.






= Archiving and Extracting a Multiple Entries

== Archiving

Given a Map of `<entryName,InputStream>`, the archiving process compresses all the given entries into a new archive in the configured format.

=== Archiver Strategies

An Archiver strategy is for compressing multiple entries into an archive.

==== Zip Archiver Strategy

When used in an operation, the Zip Archiver strategy declares that the content should be compressed with the `zip` format.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<compression:zip-archiver/>
----

=== Archive Operation

This operation receives a Map that identifies the entries to be compressed and their values. Each entry passed to this operation is placed inside the compressed archive bearing the name you provide.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<compression:archive>
   <compression:entries> // <1>
    #[
       {
         summary.pdf: vars.summary,
         'details/result_001.pdf': vars.file1
         'details/result_002.pdf': vars.file2
       }
     ]
   </compression:entries>
   <compression:archiver>
       <compression:zip-archiver/> // <2>
   </compression:archiver>
</compression:archive>
----

<1> A DataWeave script defining each name of the entry to be compressed as a key and the content of that entry as its value.
<2> The archiver strategy to be used.

The resulting archive contains _three entries_, one named `summary.pdf` at root level, the others called `result_001.pdf` and `result_002.pdf`, inside a directory called `details`:

[source]
----
+- content.zip
|  \- summary.pdf
|  \+ details
   |  \- result_001.pdf
   |  \- result_002.pdf

----

Note that the slash (`/`) in the name of an entry (for example, `details/result_001.pdf`) indicates directory separation, so all names will be introspected to create directories inside the archive.

==== Archiving Errors

If a problem occur while compressing the content, a `COMPRESSION:COULD_NOT_COMPRESS` error will be thrown.






== Extract

Decompresses content that represents an archive in some compression format.

=== Extractor Strategies

An Extractor strategy can decompress an archive with multiple entries that are compressed in a particular format.

==== Zip Strategy

When used in an operations, this strategy declares that the content should be extracted with the `zip` format.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<compression:zip-archiver/>
----

=== Extract Operation

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<compression:extract>
    <compression:compressed>#[vars.archive]</compression:compressed> // <1>
    <compression:extractor>
        <compression:zip-extractor/> // <2>
    </compression:extractor>
</compression:extract>
----


<1> The compressed content to be extracted. Defaults to `#[payload]`.
<2> The entries of this archive are returned as objects, each accessible by its name. For example, assume that an archive with three entries with the following structure is decompressed:

[source]
----
+- Archive
|  \- summary.pdf
|  \+ details
   |  \- result_001.pdf
   |  \- result_002.pdf
----

In this case, you can access the extracted contents of the entries like this: `payload['summary.pdf']` or `payload.details['result_001.pdf']`

==== Extractor Errors

If the content is not in the configured format, a `COMPRESSION:INVALID_ARCHIVE` error will be thrown. For other errors that occur during the compression process, the operation will throw a `COMPRESSION:COULD_NOT_DECOMPRESS` error.


== Common Use cases

=== Compressing a File

This example reads a file, compresses it, and saves it.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<file:read path="file.txt"/>
<compression:compress>
   <compression:compressor>
       <compression:gzip-compressor/>
   </compression:compressor>
</compression:compress>
<file:write path="file-txt.gz"/>
----


=== Decompressing a Payload from a Remote Service

This example calls a server that returns and decompresses a Zip file.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<wsc:consume config="ZipServiceConfig" operation="returnsZip"/>
<compression:decompress>
   <compression:content>
      #[payload.body.zipContent]
   </compression:content>
   <compression:decompressor>
       <compression:zip-decompressor/>
   </compression:decompressor>
</compression:decompress>
