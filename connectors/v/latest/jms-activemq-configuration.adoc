= Configuring an ActiveMQ Connection

= Connecting To ActiveMQ

Support for ActiveMQ 5 is provided out of the box by the connector using the
`active-mq-connection`. With this connection, you can use both JMS 1.1 (the default)
or JMS 1.0.2b specs, and configure all the general connection parameters for JMS,
as well as the custom parameters only present in ActiveMQ.

Once we declare the `active-mq-connection`, all that's left to do is set up the
connection factory with our custom configuration. Every parameter in the connection
comes with a default value, meaning that you are required to configure only the
parameters relevant for your use case. Also, the ActiveMQ connection exposes
parameters that are exclusive of ActiveMQ implementation, like `initialRedeliveryDelay`.

An example of a simple configuration of an ActiveMQ connection would be:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<jms:config name="JMS_Config">
 <jms:active-mq-connection >
  <jms:factory-configuration brokerUrl="tcp://localhost:61616" />
 </jms:active-mq-connection>
</jms:config>
----

[[on-memory-broker]]
== On Memory Broker

By default the ActiveMQ Connector uses a On Memory Broker, this makes it
easy to start building an application without needing to configure a connection
against a external broker.

Default URL: `vm://localhost?broker.persistent=false&broker.useJmx=false`

On Memory Broker is required to configure both <<activemq-client-lib,ActiveMQ Client>>
and <<activemq-broker-lib,ActiveMQ Broker>> libraries.

== SSL Connections

*Since JMS 1.3.0*

ActiveMQ Connections can be configured with SSL configurations, this enables
the connector to establish secure and encrypted connections against the ActiveMQ Broker.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<jms:config name="JMS_Config">
  <jms:active-mq-connection>
   <tls:context>
    <tls:trust-store
      path="client.ts"
      password="password" />
    <tls:key-store
      path="client.ks"
      password="password"
      keyPassword="password"
      alias="client" />
   </tls:context>
  </jms:active-mq-connection>
</jms:config>
----

Also the connector can reference Global TLS Context configurations, so you can
reuse and share the same TLS Context between connectors like HTTP.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<!--  HTTP Requester Configuration -->
<http:request-config name="HTTP_Request_configuration">
  <http:request-connection tlsContext="TLS_Context" />
</http:request-config>

<!--  JMS Configuration -->
<jms:config name="JMS_Config">
  <jms:active-mq-connection tlsContext="TLS_Context"/>
</jms:config>

<!--  Reusable TLS Context -->
<tls:context name="TLS_Context">
 <tls:trust-store
  path="client.ts"
  password="password" />
<tls:key-store
  path="client.ks"
  password="password"
  keyPassword="password"
  alias="client" />
</tls:context>

== Delivery Handling

[[poison-messages]]
=== Avoiding Poison Messages

When a message cannot be processed correctly, it's not acknowledged. The message
is redelivered again, probably not processing correctly again, and this
cycle executes indefinitely.

To prevent this case, where a message can't be handled and is redelivered constantly
forever, "Poison Messages", a Max Redelivery configuration can be done to set
a max number of times that a message can be delivered to the application.

.In this example a message redelivers at max 10 times.
[source, xml, linenums]
----
<jms:config name="JMS_Config">
  <jms:active-mq-connection>
    <jms:factory-configuration maxRedelivery="10"/>
  </jms:active-mq-connection>
</jms:config>
----

By default, the JMS Connector uses a `maxRedelivery` of 0, this means that messages
won't be redelivered, and doesn't matter if the message is recovered or rolled back
from a transaction.

If the message has persistent delivery set, ActiveMQ sends the message to
the DLQ.QUEUE (Dead Letter Queue).

=== Advanced Redelivery

ActiveMQ lets users have a client side redelivery configuration. You can also
configure the <<poison-messages,max times redelivery of a message>>
and how fast the connector is required to redeliver the message.

*initialRedeliveryDelay* : In milliseconds, how much time to wait until the message
is redelivered for the first time.
*redeliveryDelay* : In milliseconds, how much time to wait until the message
is redelivered after the first redeliver.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<jms:config name="JMS_Config">
  <jms:active-mq-connection>
    <jms:factory-configuration
      redeliveryDelay="100"
      initialRedeliveryDelay="1000"/>
  </jms:active-mq-connection>
</jms:config>
----

== Object Serialization

Since ActiveMQ 5.12.2 and 5.13.0, ActiveMQ restricts the classes that can be serialized
and deserialized to prevent the execution of a malicious payload that can exploit
the host system.

=== Trusted Packages

By default ActiveMQ, the connector only allows the JDK/JRE provided classes, but if you
need to exchange object messages, you need to add packages your applications are
using:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<jms:config name="JMS_Config">
  <jms:active-mq-connection>
    <jms:factory-configuration >
      <jms:trusted-packages >
        <jms:trusted-package value="com.mulesoft.someapp" />
        <jms:trusted-package value="com.mulesoft.someapp.model" />
      </jms:trusted-packages>
    </jms:factory-configuration>
  </jms:active-mq-connection>
</jms:config>
----

image:jms-trusted-packages.png[JMS ActiveMQ Trusted Packages]

In this example the JMS Connector only allows users to consume and produce ObjectMessages
compliant with the `com.mulesoft.someapp` and `com.mulesoft.someapp.model` packages.

=== Trust All Packages

Another way to enable the serialization of more classes is to enable the `trustAllPackages`
configuration, this recovers the old behavior of allowing any object to
be serialized and deserialized. This is totally disallowed to prevent
malicious attacks.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<jms:config name="JMS_Config">
  <jms:active-mq-connection>
    <jms:factory-configuration trustAllPackages="true"/>
  </jms:active-mq-connection>
</jms:config>
----

== Configuring Required Libraries

image:jms-libs.gif[Configuring Required JMS Libraries]

[[activemq-client-lib]]
=== ActiveMQ Client

The ActiveMQ Client Library is the only required to use ActiveMQ Connections, and is
needed to connect again to a broker.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<dependency>
 <groupId>org.apache.activemq</groupId>
 <artifactId>activemq-client</artifactId>
 <version>5.15.4</version>
</dependency>
----

[[activemq-broker-lib]]
=== ActiveMQ Broker

The ActiveMQ Broker can create an <<on-memory-broker,On Memory Broker>>.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<dependency>
 <groupId>org.apache.activemq</groupId>
 <artifactId>activemq-broker</artifactId>
 <version>5.15.4</version>
</dependency>
----

=== ActiveMQ KahaDB

The ActiveMQ KahaDB is required when using an <<on-memory-broker,On Memory Broker>>
but also is required to have persistent message delivery.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<dependency>
 <groupId>org.apache.activemq</groupId>
 <artifactId>activemq-kahadb-store</artifactId>
 <version>5.15.4</version>
</dependency>
