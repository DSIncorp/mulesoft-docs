_Connect anything. Change everything._

Use the Anypoint Platform to build an application network with secure, reusable integrations and APIs.

== Design and Build Integration Apps and APIs

Anypoint Studio is the Eclipse-based IDE to help you create apps and APIs, and Design Center is the cloud-based tool.

You can deploy your integration apps and APIs locally, using the standalone Mule Runtime (Mule). 
The connectors and DataWeave version you need depend on the version of Mule you use.
