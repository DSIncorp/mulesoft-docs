= Application Sizing and Resource Allocation on AnypointRuntime Fabric

This topic provides guidelines for how to determine the correct size of resources needed to provide Mule applications deployed on Anypoint Runtime Fabric. 

When an application is deployed to Runtime Fabric, it is deployed to its own Mule runtime. Resource allocations for an application are determined by the values set during deployment on the following resources:

* Replicas
* Cores
* Memory 

== Minimum Resources
There are minimum values for the amount of CPU and memory needed to start up the Mule runtime.

* CPU Cores: 0.07 cores
* Memory: 0.7 GiB memory
