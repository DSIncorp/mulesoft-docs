= Resource Allocation on Anypoint Runtime Fabric

This topic provides guidelines for how to determine the correct size of resources to allocate when deploying Mule applications on Anypoint Runtime Fabric. 

When an application is deployed to Runtime Fabric, it is deployed with its own Mule runtime. The number of replicas, or instances of that application and runtime, can be specified as well. The resources available for each replica are determined by the values set during deployment. Users can allocate the following resources:

* vCPU cores
* Memory

== Minimum Resources

There are minimum values for the amount of CPU and memory allotable for each replica of a Mule application.

* *vCPU Cores:* 0.07 cores
* *Memory:* 0.7 GiB memory

== Performance

The amount of resources given to Mule correlate with the startup time and performance expected from your application. Below is a estimate for the startup time and throughput based on the amount of vCPU cores allocated for a simple Mule application.

[%header,cols="3*a"]
|===
| vCPU Cores | Throughput (TPS) | Avg Response Time (ms)
| `0.07` |   | `rtf-aws` 
|===

== Startup times

[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
| vCPU Cores | Startup time
| `0.07` | 10 minutes
|===

[NOTE]
Performance and load testing should be performed on your Mule applications to determine the right amount of resources to allocate.
