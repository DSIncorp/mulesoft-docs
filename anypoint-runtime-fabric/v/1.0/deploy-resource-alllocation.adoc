= Determine Application Resource Allocation on Runtime Fabric
:noindex:

This topic provides guidelines for how to determine the resource allocation requirements for Mule applications deployed on Anypoint Runtime Fabric. 

When an application is deployed to a Runtime Fabric, it is deployed to its own Mule runtime. Resource allocations for an application are determined by the following:

* Number of worker nodes
* Cores
* Memory 

The amount of resources available to an application depend on the resources of your system.
