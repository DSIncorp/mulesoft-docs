= Enable an Edge Endpoint for Anypoint Runtime Fabric

All connection requests to your Mule applications deployed in a Runtime Fabric must use TLS. To guarantee that all inbound requests follow this requirement, you need to configure an edge endpoint for your Runtime Fabric to enable inbound requests to your APIs. +
You cannot expose any endpoints until you configured an edge endpoint.

== Before You Begin

* Verify that your account has at least one Anypoint Runtime Fabric installed and configured.
See link:/anypoint-runtime-fabric/v/1.0/installation[Install Anypoint Runtime Fabric] for more information.
* To validate TLS connections, your edge endpoint must have a TLS Context configured. +
Essentially, your TLS Context needs to be set up to point to a keystore that holds the certificate used to identify your edge endpoint for public key cryptography. +
You need to set up these secret types within a secret group using Anypoint Secrets Manager. Follow the link:edge-create-certificate-tls[Configure Secrets for Your Edge Endpoint].
* Ensure that you have the *Manage Runtime Fabrics* permission for your user account. +
Additionally, if you are creating configuring the TLS context, make sure you have *Grant access to secrets*, *Manage secret groups*, *Write secrets*, and *Read secrets metadata* permissions enabled for your user.

== Procedure

. In your Runtime Manager UI, select *Runtime Fabrics* on the left navigation bar.
. Select the name of your Runtime Fabric to which you want to enable edge.
. Select the *Edge Configuration* tab, and select the *Enable Edge* checkbox.
. Under *Basic Configuration*:
.. Configure your secure and non-secure ports. +
By default, secure port is 443 and the non-secure port is 80. +
Your edge endpoint only accepts HTTPS requests. If you receive an HTTPS request through your non-secure port, your edge endpoint redirects the request using a 301 to port 443.
+
[CAUTION]
--
HTTP Requests through your edge endpoint are not permitted. +
The edge endpoint returns an error on port 443 if the request is not using HTTPS.
--
.. Select the number of replicas you want. +
Edge endpoints can only run in controller nodes. If you have more than one controller node, you can set up more replicas to split traffic across replicas of your edge endpoint.
.. Determine your resource allocation. +
Determine how many cores and memory from your controller node to assign to your edge endpoint.  +
Consider that TLS connections are resource expensive. You can increase the processing capacity for your inbound connections by using more cores.
. Under *TLS Configuration*: +
Your edge endpoint uses this TLS Configuration for all inbound requests to your application. +
This configuration must be stored in a secret group. Follow the link:edge-create-certificate-tls[Configure Secrets for Your Edge Endpoint] if you don't have a TLS configuration yet.
.. In the Environment drop-down menu, select the environment of the secret group that stores the Keystore and TLS Context for your Edge instance.
.. In the Secret Group drop-down menu, select the secret group that stores the keystore and TLS Context for your Edge instance.
.. In the TLS Context drop-down menu, select the TLS Context for your Edge instance.

Additionally you can configure *Advanced Options* and *Logs*.

== Advanced Options


[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="a,a"]
|===
|Value |Description
| *Max Connections*
| The maximum amount of simultaneous connections that you are going to allow.

*Default Value*: 512

| *Max Requests Per Connection*
| The Maximum amount of requests per connections that you are allowing. +
Keep in mind that it is resource expensive to take TLS connections up and down. This value lets you reuse a connection.

*Maximum allowed*: 1000 requests per connection.

*Default Value*: 1000

| *Connection Idle Time-out*
| Maximum amount of time that you allow an idle connection. +
This value helps you terminate idle connections that take processing capacity for no reason. +
This value should always be higher than your *read request time-out*. See the option below for more information.

*Default Value*: 15 (seconds)


| *Read Request Time-out*
| Maximum amount of time that you allow your edge endpoint to read a request before terminating it. +
This value lets you terminate requests that send a very large message, or requests whose clients are very slow sending the message. +
This is useful to prevent attacks that try to consume all your connections sending very slow requests. Or to prevent clients that don't close the connection after receiving a response.

If your edge endpoint takes longer than the time set here, it will automatically close the connection. +
To ensure that this feature works as expected, this value should always be lower than the *Connection Idle Time-Out* configured above.

*Default Value*: 10 (seconds)

| *Max Pipeline Depth*
| The maximum amount of requests that you allow from the same client. +
This value lets you define how many simultaneous requests can send a client, before getting a response. +
If a client exceeds this number, the exceeding requests will not be read until the requests in the queue receive a response.

*Default Value*: 10

| *Source IP Header Name* and *Enable Proxy Protocol*
| You can use these configurations if your Runtime fabric is sitting behind a load balancer.

The values to configure here depends on your scenario:

. Your Runtime Fabric is not behind a load balancer. +
:: If your Runtime Fabric is not sitting behind a load balancer, you should not configure these values.
+
*Source IP Header Name*: blank +
*Enable Proxy Protocol*: Unchecked
. Your Runtime Fabric is behind an AWS Load Balancer with a Proxy Protocol configured. +
:: If your Runtime Fabric is deployed behind an AWS load balancer with a proxy protocol enabled, you must select the *Enable Proxy Protocol* checkmark.
+
*Source IP Header Name*: blank +
*Enable Proxy Protocol*: checked
. Your Runtime Fabric is behind a different type of Load Balancer. +
:: If your Runtime Fabric is deployed behind another type of Load Balancer (for example F5, or nginx), you need to provide two common source IP header:
+
* Forwarded: An RFC7239 compliant ip header.
* X-Forwarded-For: Non-standard pre-2014 header containing one or more IPs from a Load Balancer (For example: â€œ192.16.23.34, 172.16.21.36")
+
*Source IP Header Name*: non-blank +
*Enable Proxy Protocol*: unchecked

*Default Value*: blank and unchecked.

== Logs

You can define the log levels for your edge endpoint. Avaialble values are:

* TRACE
* DEBUG
* VERBOSE
* INFO
* WARNING
* ERROR
* FATAL

Additionally, you can apply filters to your logs. +
By default, your edge endpoint has no log filters. This means that the activity of all IPs behind your endpoint is being tracked. If you have a high amount of traffic and you don't want to use a lot of vCPU resources of your node, you can apply a filter so only specific IP addresses are tracked. +
This feature is also helpful if you are trying to debug a connection for a specific o limited number of IP addresses.

=== Configuring Logs

. Click the Add Filter.
. in the *IP* field, enter the IP addresses or sub-set of addresses using CIDR notation.
. Select the log level you want for this filter.
. Clikc OK.

After you finish configuring all these values, click *Deploy*. +
The platform displays a "Request to Deployer Sent Successfully" message.
