= Install Runtime Fabric on AWS

This topic describes how to install and register Anypoint Runtime Fabric on your AWS account.

[WARNING]
====
Before running the installer, ensure that your infrastructure meets the minimum hardware requirements. An operations specialist may be needed to provision the required infrastructure.
====

== Download Installer
The installer package includes the necessary scripts and binaries needed to install Runtime Fabric.

. Log in to Anypoint platform and navigate to Runtime Manager.
. On the left navigation pane, select "Runtime Fabrics".
. Click "Create Runtime Fabric".
. Click the installer link to begin the download.
. Once downloaded, unpack the installer using `mkdir installer && tar -zxf /path/to/installer -C installer`

[NOTE]
The extension for the installer is packaged as `tar.gz`. You'll need a utility to unpack tar files.

You'll find a directory named `aws` inside the installer, which contains the following:

* `fabric.tf`: a https://terraform.io/[Terraform] script to provision infrastructure on your AWS account.
* `README.md`: a markdown file containing installation instructions.

== Provision Infrastructure
Use the included Terraform script to easily provision the required hardware and network settings needed to install and operate Runtime Fabric.

[NOTE]
You'll need a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[key pair] to provision the VMs. This is required to enable secure access to your VMs via SSH (Secure Shell).

You'll need to configure AWS API access in your shell. For example, make sure you have `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_ACCESS_SECRET_KEY`, etc defined. You should be able to run the `aws ` cli tool, for example.

=== Variables

* `cluster_name`: name of cluster (e.g. rtf).
* `key_pair`: name of the aws keypair (e.g. my-cluster-key)
* `workers`: number of worker machines to provision. (e.g. 3)
* `controllers`: number of controller machines to provision. (e.g. 3)
* `installer_url`: url of the RTF installation package

You can either run `terraform` natively, or via `docker`.

=== With terraform
```
terraform apply \
  -var cluster_name=<cluster-name> \
  -var key_pair=<keypair-name> \
  -var controllers=3 \
  -var workers=3 \
  -var installer_url=<url> \
  -state=tf-data/rtf.tfstate
```

=== With Docker
```
docker run -v $(pwd):/src -w /src/aws \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \
  hashicorp/terraform:0.9.6 apply \
  -var cluster_name=<cluster-name> \
  -var key_pair=<keypair-name> \
  -var controllers=3 \
  -var workers=3 \
  -var installer_url=<url> \
  -state=tf-data/rtf.tfstate
```

[NOTE]
This step will install Runtime Fabric across all servers to form a cluster. It may take 15-25 minutes or longer to complete.

== Registering Runtime Fabric

After the installation script has completed, you'll need to register Runtime Fabric to Anypoint Runtime Manager.

. Navigate to Runtime Manager, select the Runtime Fabrics tab, and select the "Create Runtime Fabric" button.
. Near the registration script, choose a name for your Runtime Fabric. Copy the script to your clipboard.
. SSH onto the installer machine (first controller) running Runtime Fabric and paste and run the registration script. This process may take up to 5 minutes to complete.
. After the script completes the registration process, Runtime Fabric should be registered and visible on the "Runtime Fabrics" tab in Runtime Manager.
