= About Secret Groups

A Secret Group is a unique secrets vault to which all your secrets are bound. Each Secret Group has individual access and authorization controls.

Anypoint Secrets Manager stores your secrets per secret group, per environment, and per business group. Meaning that only applications deployed to those specific business groups and environments within your organization can access the secrets stored in each secret group.

To ensure that all clients use a consistent set of secrets, and all users edit the same set of secrets at a given time, Anypoint Secrets Manager provides both high availability and consistency of stored data, as well as concurrent use functionality for secrets renewals.

=== Availability and Consistency

By implementing "edit sessions" every time a user needs to edit secrets inside a secrets group, Anypoint Secrets Manager guarantees to serve a consistent set of secrets.

Consider the scenario where you need to renew secrets inside a secret group, you need to click the Edit button in the Anypoint Platform UI. This opens an edit session during which the secret group locks out other users, and you can edit all the necessary security objects inside the secret group. While the edit session is opened, Anypoint Secrets Manager serves the same secrets it had before you opened the edit session. This guarantees that any redeployed application would still see the same consistent secret group, even though you are modifying it. +

After you are done with your changes, you must click the Finish button in the Anypoint Platform UI. This updates the secret group with all the renewed secrets that Anypoint Secrets Manager would serve to all redeployed applications after that point.

=== Concurrency

It is possible for two users to take the same secret group out for edit. +
If a you need to edit a secret group which already has an opened edit session for another user, the Anypoint Platform UI would show you a "Cancel Edit" button next to the secret group, along with the name of the user who has the group out for edit.

If the editing user forgets about its opened edit session and is not available, you can click the "Cancel Edit" button to clear the first user's session. This deletes all changes made during the edit session of the first user, but allows you to click the now available Edit button to open a new edit session.
