= To Set Error Breakpoints

To set the *error* parameter for the application, click the errorsÂ button.

This parameter causes any Event Processor in the application to become a breakpoint if it throws an error. In such a case, Studio stops flow execution at the event processor which threw the error, then displays the message in the Mule Debugger View.

Additionally, Studio identifies the error with a red, dotted-line square in the processor that failed during execution.
