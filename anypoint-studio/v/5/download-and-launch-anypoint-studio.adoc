== Updating Studio

Anypoint Studio notifies you when an update is available.

[TIP]
You can also check this manually going to *Help* > *Check for Updates*.

Keep in mind that updating your Studio installation to the latest release using this method does not update the bundled Runtime version that's announced in the link:/release-notes/anypoint-studio[release notes].

If you updated Studio from the update site and want to get the announced runtime version bundled with your version of Studio follow these steps:

. Go to *Help* > *Install New Software ...*.
. In the _Work with_ drop down menu select *Anypoint Studio Update Site*.
. Expand the *Anypoint Studio* entry.
. Select the *Mule Server Runtime {version}* that appears listed.
. Follow the instructions on screen to complete the installation.
