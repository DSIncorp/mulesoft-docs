= Getting started with Custom Policies development

Custom Policies are policies that anyone can develope and apply to their APIs, with the intention of extending existing
functionality or defining new ones.

The current workflow to get a working policy for Mule 4 that can be applied in Anypoint Platform consists of

. Develop the policy.
. Package the policy.
. Upload the resulting policy assets to Exchange.
. Apply the policy to any API through API Manager.


== Setting up a project with the archetype

The first step of developing a custom policy consists in setting up a project with the files needed for creating a policy.
We are going to use Maven in order to do that and also for packaging it into a deployable JAR.

The easiest way to do this is through the use of a maven archetype that will create necessary files for us

*Prerequisites for using the archetype*

Archetype is not currently available in Maven Central Repository, so it is necessary first to configure Maven so it can find the
archetype in one of MULE's repositories.

One way to do so is by configuring Maven's `settings.xml` with the following section

[source,xml,linenums]
----
 <profiles>
   <profile>
     <id>archetype-repository</id>
     <repositories>
       <repository>
         <id>archetype</id>
         <name>Mule Repository</name>
         <url>https://repository-master.mulesoft.org/nexus/content/repositories/public</url>
         <releases>
           <enabled>true</enabled>
           <checksumPolicy>fail</checksumPolicy>
         </releases>
         <snapshots>
           <enabled>true</enabled>
           <checksumPolicy>warn</checksumPolicy>
         </snapshots>
       </repository>
     </repositories>
   </profile>
 </profiles>
----

Once Maven is configured

. Create a new directory where the custom policy project will live
. Go to that directory in the command line
. Execute the following command:

[source,bash,linenums]
----
mvn -Parchetype-repository archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.mule.tools -DarchetypeArtifactId=api-gateway-custom-policy-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=1.0.0 -DgroupId=${orgId} -DartifactId=${policyName} -Dversion=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
----

Replacing:

* `${orgId}` with Anypoint Plaform Organization Id where the policy will be uploaded to.
** Get your organization ID from *Access Management > Organization*:
*** Click the name of your organization.
*** Copy the UUID from the browser address. For example, copy 2a4b93c3-7899-4ea7-9374-f787744d8784 from the URL.

* `${policyName}` with the desired name for the custom policy

After running the command, the project’s directory will have a structure similar to:

----
my-custom-policy/
├── my-custom-policy.yaml
├── mule-artifact.json
├── pom.xml
└── src
   └── main
       └── mule
           └── template.xml
----

Those 4 files are the basic ones needed for having a working policy. A brief comment on each

* *pom.xml*
** `groupId` is defined as the organization ID used with the archetype. This value must remain as it is.
** `mule-policy` packaging, so packager plugin can successfully build the JAR.
** `distributionManagement` section is defined pointing to user’s Exchange.
** `com.google.code.maven-replacer-plugin:replacer` used to replace values in mule-artifact.json that should always match values defined in this pom.
** `mule-maven-plugin` responsible of packaging the policy into a deployable jar
** `maven-deploy-plugin` configured to deploy both the resulting jar and the YAML when uploading the policy to Exchange

* *mule-artifact.json* exists for the mule-maven-plugin. This is the same file you need for Mule applications.

* *my-custom-policy.yaml* exists to render the policy configuration UI. If this file is not provided, the policy won’t be able to be applied through API Platform’s UI.

* *template.xml* where the actual logic of the policy and Mule configuration that defines the policy behavior.

The archetype, by default, generates a basic policy that sets the returned HTTP Response payload to a “Hello World!” message. That
is implemented with the following configuration:

.XML element
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mule xmlns="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core"
     xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
     xmlns:http="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/http"
     xmlns:http-policy="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/http-policy"
     xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core/current/mule.xsd
              http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/http http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/http/current/mule-http.xsd
              http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/http-policy http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/http-policy/current/mule-http-policy.xsd">

   <http-policy:proxy name="{{{policyId}}}-custom-policy"> // <1>
       <http-policy:source> // <2>
           <http-policy:execute-next/> // <3>
           <set-payload value="Hello World!" />
       </http-policy:source>
   </http-policy:proxy>
</mule>
----

<1> Basic structure for defining a policy. `{{{policyId}}}` refers to a HandleBars variable. HandleBars is a templating framework
that allows to create more complex policies.
<2> Source refers to inbound HTTP requests. The other option is to define logic for an outbound HTTP request.
<3> Explicit element which indicates that the next policy or flow should be executed. Any element placed before it will be executed
before jumping to the next, and any element place after that will be executed after returning from the next.

Now that the project is set, logic can be updated as necessary with your requirements. Policy engine is very powerful and allows
to do things like modifying HTTP Requests and Responses, Logging, Caching, Throttling and almost any other integration that can be done with Mule.
