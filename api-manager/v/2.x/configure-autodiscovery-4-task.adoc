= Configuring API Autodiscovery in a Mule 4 Application

To configure API Autodiscovery in your Mule 4.x application, you must meet the following requirements:

== Making your API Available in API Manager

The API to which you want to pair your Mule application must be available in API Manager. +
You can either:

* Publish your API in Exchange and import it from there to API Manager. +
See link:/api-manager/v/2.x/manage-exchange-api-task[To Manage an API from Exchange].
* Import it directly from your machine. +
See link:/api-manager/v/2.x/import-api-task[To Import an API Instance] for more details.

API Manager generates an "API ID" identifier for every imported API:

This API ID is required by the Autodiscovery element to identify the API to which you want to pair your application.

== Configuring API Manager

. For Managing type, select Basic Endpoint.
. Add the Implementation URI that points to the deployed Mule application.
. Select the checkmark `Check this box if you are managing this API in Mule 4 or above`.

== Configuring Anypoint Platform Organization Credentials in Mule Runtime
//_TODO: Remove this after DOCS-2581 is done.
To use Autodiscovery in a Mule Application, the Runtime must start with Anypoint Platform credentials already configured. +
There are two types of credentials that you can use: Organization's client ID and secret, or typically, environment's client ID and secret.

[TIP]
If you configured a proxy endpoint for your API and choose to take advantage of the platform deployment capabilities, such as 1-Click deployment, the Anypoint Platform credentials will be automatically set for you in your autogenerated proxy.


=== Getting Environment's Information

In Anypoint Platform, logged as an administrator, click Access Management, Environments, and click the environment in which your API is being managed. +
The environment's info appears:

=== Getting Organization's Information

In Anypoint Platform, logged as an administrator, click Access Management, Organization, and click your target organization name. +
The organization info appears:

=== Configuring Anypoint Platform Credentials in Mule Runtime

==== Standalone Installation.

. Navigate to your $MULE_HOME directory.
. Open the file located in  `/conf/wrapper.conf`
. Add your Anypoint Platform Organization credentials in these configurations:
+
[source,linenums]
----
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.client_id=XXXXXXXX
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.client_secret=XXXXXXXX
----
+
In these arguments you can pass both organization, or environment credentials.

==== Anypoint Platform.

. Navigate to Runtime Manager in Anypoint Platform.
. Access the Properties section of the deployed application. If the application is being deployed for the first time, the Properties section will appear during the deployment configuration.
. In the Properties section, add the following properties:
+
[source,linenums]
----
anypoint.platform.client_id=XXXXXXXX
anypoint.platform.client_secret=XXXXXXXX
----

==== Anypoint Studio 7

You can also pass these credentials in Anypoint Studio 7:

. In Anypoint Studio, click Anypoint Studio from the top menu bar, and Preferences.
. Under Anypoint Studio, click API Manager
. Type in the client ID and secret under Environment Credentials

== Configuring the Autodiscovery Element in Your Mule Application

Within the code of your Mule Application, you must configure the `api-gateway:Autodiscovery` element. +
The Autodiscovery element points to the specific API in API Manager to which you want to pair.

[TIP]
If you configured a proxy endpoint for your API, your autogenerated proxy will already be correctly configured with the Autodiscovery element.

.XML element
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<api-gateway:autodiscovery
  apiId="${apiId}" // <1>
  flowRef="myFlow" /> // <2>
----

<1> Configure the `apiId` with the API ID that API Manager assigned to your API.
<2> Set the `flowRef` element to point to the flow that you want to pair to the API in API Manager.

You can either replace `${apiId}` with your specific value, or you can create a `config.properties` file where you define it in a key-value fashion: `apiId=[your-specific-value]` and reference it as `${apiId}` in this configuration.

You can also configure this using Anypoint Studio's UI:

. In your existing flow, select the Global Elements tab in your Mule Configuration File editor.
. Click the Create button, and look for the API Autodiscovery global element.
+

. Set the API ID and Flow Reference. +
+
image::auto-discovery-api-config.png[align=center]
+
You can also choose to use the `${apiId}` value and reference it from a `config.properties` file.

After the element is defined in the application, and the runtime is configured  with your Anypoint Platform credentials, Mule Runtime will automatically track and keep up to date with the API configuration. defined in API Manager.
//_COMBAK: Does this need to be deployed for the green dot to show in API Manager?

== Changes from Mule 3.x Configuration

API Autodiscovery element has syntactically changed from Mule 3.x but its purpose remains the same. The element in a Mule Application has the following format:

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="a,a"]
|===
^| Mule 3.x XML element ^| Mule 4.x XML element
^| <api-platform-gw:api (...)/>. ^| <api-gateway:autodiscovery (...)/>.
|===

In Mule 4, the API is identified by the API Id and a reference to a Flow where the HTTP listener is defined. Mule 4â€™s apiId replaces the apiName and apiVersion used to specify the Autodiscovery element in Mule 3.x and prior.
