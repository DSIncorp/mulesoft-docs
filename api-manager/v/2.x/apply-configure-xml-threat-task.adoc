== Purpose

XML requests are susceptible to attacks characterized by unusual inflation of elements, attributes and nesting levels. Attackers use recursive techniques to consume memory resources. Dramatic swings in the size of the application data often signal a security problem. The XML threat protection policy helps protect your applications from such intrusions.

In the event Mule Runtime fails to detect an attack, you need to monitor and design your services architecture with layers of protection in addition to these policies.
