The _Policies_ link contains a list of policies you can to the API.

If a policy is already applied, or if the protection it provides is already fulfilled by a policy you applied, the policy appears unavailable. You can filter the list by policy categories:

* Compliance
* Security
* Quality of Service
* Transformation
* Troubleshooting

After selecting a category, you can further filter the list by the type of protection it fulfills.
