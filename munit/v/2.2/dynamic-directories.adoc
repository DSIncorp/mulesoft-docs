When managing files and folders during a test, MUnit provides a property that references a temporary directory.
The name of the property is _munit.temporary.directory_. This folder
can be used to create files and folders inside it, which will be *deleted at the end of each test*.

For example, using the file connector, you could configure the working directory as follows:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<file:config name="tmpDir">
    <file:connection workingDir="${munit.temporary.directory}"/>
</file:config>
----

and then use it to create files/folders inside it:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<file:create-directory config-ref="tmpDir" directoryPath="example"/>
----
