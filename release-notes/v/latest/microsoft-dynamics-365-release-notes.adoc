* Fixed Read Timeout default value. Default was always 5 seconds even if setting was not specified or set to 0.
Now, if ReadTimeout is not specified, the default is 5 seconds, else if ReadTimeout is less or equal to 0 (zero), 
the default is an infinite wait.

|Software |Version
|Mule Runtime | Mule Runtime Enterprise Edition 3.6.0 and later

=== Features

* No new features added.

=== Fixed in this Release

* Dynamics 365 Connector was not releasing immediately the connections with an error response (HTTP error code >= 400).
 The Olingo protocol doesn't release a connection immediately if the response is not consumed, so we forced the connector to consume the response even if it's an error response.

=== Known Issues

* No known issues.

== 1.0.2

*April 27, 2018*

=== Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Software |Version
|Mule Runtime | Mule Runtime Enterprise Edition 3.6.0 and later
|===

=== Features

* No new features added.

=== Fixed in this Release

* This connector was throwing a TimeOutException after receiving a 204 response from the API for an update operation. This was happening because the HTTP client we are using has some memory leaks and we had to override the default implementation.
* This connector was throwing a TimeOutException after 30 seconds even if the configured timeout value was greater. Now the exception is thrown after the configured timeout value.
* This connector was creating a new connection for each request, not using the maximum number of connections configured in the pool. Another issue here was that the connections were never released. Now the issues are fixed.
* This connector does not refresh OAuth token after expiration.
* Creating an entity with a GUID using this connector throws metadata error.
* This connector does not support `Edm.Date`.
* Fixed the `edm.datetimeoffset` issue.
* Null values not accepted for Int32 fields.
* Error when converting decimal fields.
* Unauthorized (HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized) error raised when token expired.

== 1.0.0
